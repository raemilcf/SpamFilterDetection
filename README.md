### Spam Filter Detection - Classification Analysis
This project is part of the work completed during my first term in the AI & ML program at Lambton College. The focus is on performing a classification analysis to detect spam emails.

#### Overview
Spam detection is a critical application of machine learning in the field of email filtering. The primary goal of this project is to classify emails as spam or not spam (ham) based on their content and various features.

#### Objectives
- Perform a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
- Build and evaluate classification models to predict whether an email is spam.
- Interpret the results and identify key features influencing spam detection.

#### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Tokenizing and vectorizing the email text.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Scaling and normalizing numerical features.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
- Identifying potential correlations between features.
  
#### Model Building:
- Implementing various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines.
- Tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
  
#### Model Evaluation:
- Using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
- Comparing different models and selecting the best-performing one.

#### Interpretation and Insights:
- Analyzing feature importances.
- Drawing conclusions about the key factors affecting spam detection.

#### Tools and Libraries
- Python: The primary programming language used.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing classification models and evaluation metrics.
- NLTK: For natural language processing tasks.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
